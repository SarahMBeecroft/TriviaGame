# Trivia Game - The Office

## A simple timed trivia game based on one of my favorite TV shows - The Office! 

### Game Directions

* When you hit start, you'll see a 30 second timer start to count down. 

* Select from 1 of 4 answers and hit "Submit Answer" to see your result before progressing to the next question. If you don't select a question, you'll be taken to the next question automatically after 30 seconds. 

* After completing (or not answering) all 8 questions, you'll see a result screen with your correct guesses, incorrect guesses, and unanswered questions. 

**Note: I'm still working out the kinks to get this game fully functional.**
